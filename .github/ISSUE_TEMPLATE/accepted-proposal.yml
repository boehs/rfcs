        # Summary

        A brief, one or two sentence explanation of the proposal.

        # Background & Motivation

        Include any useful background detail that that explains why this RFC is important.
        What are the problems that this RFC sets out to solve? Why now? Be brief!

        It can be useful to illustrate your RFC as a user problem in this section.
        (ex: "Users have reported that it is difficult to do X in Astro today.")

        # Goals

        A **concise, bulleted-list** outlining the intended goals of this RFC. 

        - What are the exact problems that you are trying to solve with this RFC?
        - Separate these goals from the solution that you will outline below.
        - If this RFC isn't approved, these goals can be used to develop alternative solutions.

        # Non-Goals 

        A **concise, bulleted-list** outlining anything intentionally left out of this RFC:

        - Non-goal: A goal that is intentionally not addressed in this RFC.
        - Out-of-scope: A goal that is related, but intentionally avoided here.
        - Future: A goal that is related, but left to be addressed in the future.

        This gives the reader the correct context on what is intentionally left out of scope.
        It is okay to leave this section empty.

        # Example

        If the proposal involves a new or changed API, then include a basic code example.
        Otherwise, omit this section if it's not applicable.
