# Summary

Create a general-purpose `Astro.url` helper. Deprecate `Astro.canonicalURL` in favor of using `Astro.url` instead.

# Example

```js
// Before:
const currentPathname = Astro.canonicalURL.pathname;
const currentPathnameAlternativeAPI = new URL(Astro.request.url).pathname;
const origin = new URL(Astro.request.url).origin;
// After:
const currentPathname = Astro.url.pathname;
const origin = Astro.url.origin;
```

```js
// Before:
const canonicalURL = Astro.canonicalURL;
// After:
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
```

```js
// More complex example (from Astro monorepo)
// Before:
const canonicalURL = new URL(new URL(Astro.request.url).pathname, Astro.site ?? `http://example.com`);
// After:
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site ?? `http://example.com`);
```

# Motivation

Since the release of `Astro.request` there has been confusion over when to use `Astro.canonicalURL` over `Astro.request.url`. How did the two values differ, and when should I use one over the other? The answer often is: it depends.

## Creating `Astro.url`

Since `Astro.request.url` was released, we have seen the following common pattern emerge in our community:

```js
const pathname = new URL(Astro.request.url).pathname
```

`Astro.request` is a standard Request object, which means that `url` is a string. To get its pathname, you need to wrap it in a new URL object, or do some other modification to it yourself. This introduces two problems that we would like to solve:

- Less boilerplate for such a common usecase, such as getting the current URL pathname, domain, etc.
- Lower barrier to entry, for users who don't know how to create their own `URL` object to solve this.

Adding a helper `Astro.url` will reduce boilerplate in our users projects, add trivial complexity to Astro core, and give us a `Astro.canonicalURL` alternative that users will be happy with.


## Deprecating `Astro.canonicalURL` in favor of `Astro.url`

It's difficult for a framework to understand the concept of "canonical URL", since canonical is a concept that can mean different things to different projects. For example:

- How does Astro know if multiple pages should have the same canonical URL?
- In SSR mode, `[...foo].astro` will generate a different canonical URL for every URL path.

In addition, there was confusion over the canonical domain used:

- If `Astro.site` is set, what domain does `Astro.canonicalURL` use?
- If `Astro.site` is not set, what domain does `Astro.canonicalURL` use?

The result is that `Astro.canonicalURL` may not always be what the user expects. We tell the user it is "canonical", but in some cases we have no way to know what a "canonical" pathname means for the user or what your production domain actually us. Astro does its best to guess, but this can give a false sense of security where the `Astro.canonicalURL` value is actually incorrect without the user realizing it. Today, this is most common when in SSR (where every pathname generates a different canonical URL) and when `Astro.site` is not set (where we use the current origin instead of known production origin).

Even with `Astro.canonicalURL`, a user still needs to learn how to construct full URLs themselves for other meta tags like `og:image`. Even wit a helper for one very specific `canonical` meta tag, the user gets no help for creating the other meta tags that require full URL construction. You can see this today in the docs repo.

While searching, I couldn't find any equivalent site frameworks or site builders that attempted to create a "canonical" idea themselves. Instead, the best provide good primitives that a user can use to create their own canonical URL from. I believe that this is due to the issues described above, where a site builder can never have the full user/business knowledge to say with certainty what is "canonical" and what isn't.



# Detailed design

```js
// Added to Astro core
Astro.url = new URL(Astro.request.url);
```

```diff
// Deprecated, replaced with a warning
// to use `Astro.url` instead.
- Astro.canonicalURL = ...
```

This is the meat of the change. You can see the full implementation here: https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/3959

# Drawbacks

Removing a well-used property like `Astro.canonicalURL` comes with the drawback of a required user migration to the new `Astro.url` property. We can mitigate this pain with a warning and trivial backwards-compatibility for users who continue to `Astro.canonicalURL`. A phased out, complete removal of `Astro.canonicalURL` could come later (post-v1.0 or even v2.0).

This RFC is adds a new feature, `Astro.url`, that has more general usage in more scenarios. It deprecates `Astro.canonicalURL` that has 1 specific use-case. The tradeoff is that it is now slightly more work to produce a "canonical" URL but less work to get the current URL pathname, origin, etc. However, the "more work" needed to create a canonical URL yourself is also now more explicit, so that there is less room for confusion about what the ultimate value is when you build your site.


# Alternatives

#### `Astro.getCanonicalURL()`

> `getCanonicalUrl(site?: string, pathname?: string)` this gives you in-line editor docs on what it's constructing, with an option for manual overrides or specifying a site when absent in your config

- Pros: Throws if `Astro.site` wasn't defined, or lets you provide your own domain as an argument
- Cons: Added complexity, doesn't solve the deeper root issues defined in "Motivation" above

# Adoption strategy

In a single PR, we can:

- Add `Astro.url`.
- Add a deprecation console warning when you use `Astro.canonicalURL` .
- Simplify the current `Astro.canonicalURL` implementation to use `Astro.url` internally.
- Deprecate `Astro.canonicalURL` in our docs.

In a future release (post-v1.0) we can remove `Astro.canonicalURL` entirely.
